## BZZ-Commons

These repositories were created by teachers of the Bildungszentrum ZÃ¼richsee (https://www.bzz.ch). We use GitHub Classroom in teaching our students the fundamentals of application engineering. The scripts, applications and workflows in the repositories are used in our courses.

You are free to use, adapt and extend those solutions to your needs. We'd love to hear from you and how you used/adapted our solutions.
